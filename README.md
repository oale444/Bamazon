    Then create a Table inside of that database called products.

    The products table should have each of the following columns:

    item_id (unique id for each product)

    product_name (Name of product)

    department_name

    price (cost to customer)

    stock_quantity (how much of the product is available in stores)

    Populate this database with around 10 different products. (i.e. Insert "mock" data rows into this database and table).

    Then create a Node application called bamazonCustomer.js. Running this application will first display all of the items available for sale. Include the ids, names, and prices of products for sale.
